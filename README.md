Epistler
===========

Epistler lets you writer your own augmented reality epistles, in the manner of
[Between Page and Screen](http://betweenpageandscreen.com/).

You can try it out here: http://betweenpageandscreen.com/epistles

This AS3 project uses the [bps-binding](http://github.com/doolittle/bps-binding) to build a preview for the editor and
display the epistles.
